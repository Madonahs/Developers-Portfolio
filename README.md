## Handling config files:
Since config files may contain sensitive information about our app, it's best practice to not put them
out on the public repo for the whole world to see. Therefore, we decided to share them privately
among team members. 

Currently, we have 2 json config files, *credentials.json* and *google-services.json*, that our app requires in order to work properly. 
These files are required in order for google sign in features to work.

1. Download **credentials.json** and **google-services.json** from our *GrowWithGoogleTeam* slack team.
(if you would like to be invited, send your email to syombuamadona@gmail.com)

2. Copy the downloaded files above into the **app** folder of your project.

    a. Open the **Devs-Portfolio-App** app on Android Studio.
    
    b. Change the file explore view to **Project** (default view is usually *Android*)
    
    c. Right-click the **app** folder and paste in the config files
    
3. Rebuild project.
